## 🎯 Assignment Background

This project is part of **Assignment 3** in the course **Web Programming I (2024)**. The goal was to create a portfolio website with multiple linked pages using HTML, CSS, and GitHub.

Key requirements and learning goals included:

- Creating a GitHub repository with an MIT license and README file  
- Cloning the repo locally and moving existing files into it  
- Committing changes and handling merge conflicts via branching  
- Managing branches (`main` and `dev`), merging, and pushing updates  
- Deploying the site using GitHub Pages from the `docs/` folder  

This assignment helped me practice fundamental skills in:

- HTML and CSS for web layout  
- Git version control and branch management  
- Using GitHub’s web and local editing tools  
- Deploying static sites with GitHub Pages
