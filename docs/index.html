    <h3> About Me</h3>
    <div class="text">
      <p>As a junior developer, I'm really passionate about diving into advanced concepts and incorporating them into my
        software projects to make them more efficient. I'm an IT student based in Finland, currently studying
        Information Technology at the University of Eastern Finland.<br><br>

        During my time at university, I've had some great opportunities to work on different projects and enhance my
        skills. I've been able to create some cool stuff along the way, including simple games in C Language, HTML &
        CSS, Python, and Java. Some of the projects I've worked on are:<br><br>
        - "Who Wants to be A Millionaire" game (in C, Java, and Python)<br>
        - "University Cafeteria" project using JavaScript with the React library<br>
        - "Escape Game" using HTML & CSS.<br><br>

        My goal here on LinkedIn is to share what I'm learning and provide some quick tips to help others level up their
        programming skills. I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, React, Git, and NodeJS. I'm currently
        exploring new concepts and refining my development abilities.<br><br>

        I'm really excited to connect with others in the industry and learn from their experiences. I'm also on the
        lookout for potential collaboration opportunities or a chance to participate in a programming traineeship. If
        you think there's a way for us to work together or if you have some valuable insights to share, I'd love to hear
        from you.<br><br>

        Let's connect at the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page and see where this journey takes us!</p>
